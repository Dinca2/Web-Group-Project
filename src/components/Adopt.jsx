      Thank you so much for considering an adoption from our shelter! Our goal is to find the pet that is right for YOUR family. The adoption process does require you filling out any paperwork ahead of time.
      If you have another dog at home, and you would like to have a supervised introduction, we can set that up as well. We recommend visiting an animal first to make sure that it is a good candidate for your home. If you decide you would like to proceed with a meet and greet, our staff can coordinate this at the shelter. We have a secured outside fenced in area next to our adoption building that provides ample space for this introduction.</p>

      You can view all of our adoptable animals here.  We update their availability and location in real time. If you see them, they are still available for adoption. There is no appointment needed to visit our pets.
